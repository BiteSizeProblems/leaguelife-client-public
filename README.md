## About League Life
League Life combines League Racing with Smart Management Tools to reduce your overhead and deliver exceptional experiences.

Managing a league is a great opportunity to provide memorable racing experiences for sim racers all around the world. Unfortunately, many of the routine tasks required of league owners and supporting staff can become time intensive, meaning that updating results, schedules, team assignments and many other pieces of information drivers feed off become delayed, souring the experience.

League Life automates the most time intensive tasks so that you can focus more on the racing, and less on the paperwork.

#### League Structure 
Designed to reduce the burden of managing leagues, League Life presents a unique structure system, providing you with the ability to refine views to only the information you need to see.

##### Series'

##### Divisions
Each division presents an opportunity for exanding leagues to divide drivers of a single racing title across multiple levels. The division feature was initially designed to support leagues where a series had grown popular enough to support two independent schedules. While not every league requires more than one division, feedback and suggestions are welcomed to improve this experience.

##### Seasons
While a number of other league management applications present leagues as a 'single season', League Life divisions can house multiple seasons. As is commonplace in real-world motorsports, seasons represent a new iteration of a championship series. Housing multiple seasons under a single divisions allows leagues to keep track of historical results in a single location. This makes tracking historical results far easier and avoids trauling through seasons from multiple series and divisions to find the information you need.

The following properties are unique to each season:
+ Events Schedule
+ Enrolled Drivers
+ Standings & Results
+ Incident Reports



##### Events
:calendar: Build events for each season using the interactive calendar to select each race day and time.

Once your events have been built, view and edit them in a list or calendar view to make sure you stay on top of your schedule.

Events automatically classify as complete based on the race date.

Completed events also appear in the Results section, making it easier to identify races waiting for results.

  + Configure your event points model to include sprint races or half points
  + Enter session results using the interactive 'drag-n-drop' feature
  + Mark attendance for each driver, allowing you to keep track of your most and least active drivers
  + Assign reserve drivers to a team for a single event
  + Keep track of drivers that finished the race
  + View your provisional results prior to submitting them to update your drivers and constructors standings
